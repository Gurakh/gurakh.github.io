# Hi !

The purpose of this small website is to showcase some of the work I've been doing these past years. The goal is to make it light yet elegant.

It's made with Astro in TypeScript and takes advantage of GitHub Pages and CI for hosting and automatically deploying it. I liked the idea of being able to change the content directly from GitHub if needed since all projects are stored in Markdown.
